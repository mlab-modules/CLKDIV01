summary: "Multiple division ratios can be selected by jumpers. Possible division ratios\
  \ are: (\xF71, \xF72, \xF74, \xF78) or (\xF72, \xF74, \xF78, \xF716) every output\
  \ is synchronous each other. The common enable (EN) is synchronous so that the internal\
  \ dividers will only be enabled/disabled when the internal clock is already in the\
  \ LOW state."
